# CSC112-Slides
Slides for my Introduction to Computer Science II class. 
These slides are all in LaTeX beamer format.  Feel free to use them
under the terms of the CC-BY-SA-4.0 license.

I am morally opposed to committing rendered pdf's, so if you want to
see them in rendered form, you should take a look at my course
website.  There you will find the current iteration of the course, as
well as previous versions.  You will also be able to follow my
assignments!
